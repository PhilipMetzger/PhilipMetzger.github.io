## Blogs I like

[Rachel's Blog] is full of realistic cynicism. 
[Dan Luu], is always insightful. 
[Julia Evans], her short exploratory blogs helped me.
[Bruce Dawson], he always shows interesting perf problems.
[Matklad], writes succinct articles about Rust and Zig.
[Gankra], on point with the programming language analysis.

### Rachelbythebay

Probably my favorite series so far, how releasing stuff to a massive fleet 
broke stuff.

[Releasing software to the fleet far too quickly broke stuff]
[Moving fleet software releases to a massively sharded scheme]
[Rolling out the "push train"]

And some other gems from her

[Replacing "scripter mentality" code]
[Reaching a quorum of machines]
[Looking for the duct tape]

And a special shoutout to the random numbers series

### Fly.io
