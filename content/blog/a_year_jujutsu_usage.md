[Jujutsu Discord][jj])

(Sidenote: It was primarily used for contributing here and personal projects)  
As a pretty stupid user of Git, I really like all the changes and it being less
footgunny. I really like revsets, they make the log a really useful tool. Some 
features I'm missing `jj run` (the author should really get to it)[^1], blame, 
`jj sync`, `jj submit` and change detection. As I've written a bunch of 
documentation, I think there should be some sort of polish for the tutorial as 
quite a lot has changed and I think we should provide some guides like: 
_What are  some similar workflows to 'git add -p'_ that could be used in a 
Codelab. And I really enjoy contributing here and meeting Martin and Ilya was
cool.


[^1]: I'm calling myself out, if that is not _obvious_.
