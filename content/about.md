# About me

Hello I'm Philip Metzger.

I like to work in infrastructure and I'm always open to learn new things.

<!-- Any of these Roles describe me: Platform Developer, Site Reliability Engineer
Software Engineer, Compiler Developer -->

I'm interested in Build Systems, Databases, Version Control and Devtools.
I also like Monorepos, LLVM, SQLite, SerenityOS and the network stack.


## Papers I like

[GFS], a classic.  
[OWL], distributing terabytes at Meta.  
[Scuba], Facebook's monitoring solution.  
[Monarch], Borgmon but better.  
[GHost], building a fast userspace scheduler.
